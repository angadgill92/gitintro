When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If i want to collaborate with other people on a project, or if I want my code
    to be available to me across multiple devices, I'd much prefer using a remote 
    repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    idea to always pull changes manually to avoid having to debug it later.
